# Units

**TLDR**

- Use `rem`s for `font-size`
- Use `px` for `padding`, `margin` and `border`

Use Rems for fonts and pixels for box model properties like padding/margin/border. There is one exception: padding percentages can be used to preserve specific aspect ratios, as a fallback for a modern CSS property.
